# dragAndPosJS

Useful when you want to position a CSS object by eye or if you need to get an idea of any positioning pattern you may need.

Call the dragAndPos function taking in two parameters.
The first one is a jQuery DOM object of the element you want to position.
The second one is where you want the output to be.
The output will show the CSS position of the element you're moving around.
Paste the code into your CSS file and its default position will be where you last dragged it.
Note that the draggable function overwrites CSS positioning at the moment of use.
Otherwise, the position will stick and is completely responsive.
