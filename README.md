# dragAndPosJS

Useful when you want to position a CSS object by eye or if you need to get an idea of any positioning pattern you may need.__

Call the dragAndPos function taking in two parameters.__
The first one is a jQuery DOM object of the element you want to position.__
The second one is where you want the output to be.__
The output will show the CSS position of the element you're moving around.__
Paste the code into your CSS file and its default position will be where you last dragged it.__
Note that the draggable function overwrites CSS positioning at the moment of use.__
Otherwise, the position will stick and is completely responsive. __
