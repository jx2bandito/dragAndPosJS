# dragAndPosJS

Useful when you want to position a CSS object by eye or if you need to get an idea of any positioning pattern you may need.<br /> 

Call the dragAndPos function taking in two parameters.<br /> 
The first one is a jQuery DOM object of the element you want to position.<br /> 
The second one is where you want the output to be.<br /> 
The output will show the CSS position of the element you're moving around.<br /> 
Paste the code into your CSS file and its default position will be where you last dragged it.<br /> 
Note that the draggable function overwrites CSS positioning at the moment of use.<br /> 
Otherwise, the position will stick and is completely responsive. <br />
